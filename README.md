Rules

For now, please see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheng_Ji . (The Readme be updated when I get a chance.)

##Overview
In Tractor, there are two teams of 2: north-south and east-west. There are 13 *levels* corresponding to the 13 card values: 2, 3, ... 10, J, Q, K, A. Both teams start at level 2 and want to be the first team to successfully pass level A. The team that finishes level A first wins. 

##Rounds
In order for a team to pass a level, they must successfully defend a *round* for that level. The defending team members are called the *defenders* and the other two players are called the *attackers*. The *defenders* must prevent the *attackers* from scoring 80 points. The point scoring system will be explained shortly.
