##Overview
Tractor is played with two standard decks of cards with jokers. There are two teams of two people: north-south and east-west. There are thirteen *levels* corresponding to the thirteen card values: 2, 3, ... 10, J, Q, K, A. Both teams start at level 2 and want to be the first team to successfully pass level A. The team that finishes level A first wins. 

##Rounds
In order for a team to pass a level, they must successfully defend a *round* for that level. The defending team members are called the *defenders* and the other two players are called the *attackers*. In order to successfully defend a round, The defenders must prevent the attackers from scoring 80 points. The point scoring system will be explained shortly.

##Tricks and Points
In each round, exactly twenty-five tricks will be played. The player who wins the trick will win all the cards played in that trick for his/her team. The mechanics of winning a trick will be explained shortly. 

All 5s are worth 5 points, all 10s are worth 10 points, and all Ks are worth 10 points. If the attackers win any 5s, 10s, or Ks, the point values are added to their score. If the defenders win any 5s, 10s, or Ks, they simply prevent the attackers from obtaining those points. If a card is not a 5, 10, or K, it is worth 0 points and does not really matter with respect to the scoring system.
